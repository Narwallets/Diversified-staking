### TO DO & Help needed


#### Smart Contract  
 - [x] Deposit/withdraw
 - [x] Buy stNEAR/Stake
 - [x] Sell stNEAR/immediate unstake
 - [x] Classic unstake-wait-finish-unstake
 - [x] User trip-meter, measure rewards
 - [x] distribute staking/unstaking
 - [x] retrieve unstaked and ready
 - [x] NEAR/stNEAR Liquidity Pool, Add/Remove liquidity
 - [x] clearing mechanism on stake to restore liquidity in the NSLP
 - [x] act as a NEP-xxx MULTI-FUN-TOK (multi-token contract). Implement for NEAR, stNEAR and META
 - [ ] Dividends-pool stNEAR/META
 - [x] Staking-loans to whitelisted validators
 - [ ] Emergency Staking (from the nslp) to whitelisted validators

#### Test
 - [x] Simulation tests
 - [x] Fuzzy Testing

#### Staking pool list
 - [x] List selected staking pools, getting weight, staked & unstaked
 - [x] add a staking pool, set weight

#### Governing
 - [x] Mint and distribute META with rewards
 - [ ] Phase II - Governing DAO

#### Infrastructure
- [x] External cron to call distribute()
- [x] compute remaining epoch time
- [x] whitelist pools before adding them

#### Expansions

- [x] USDNEAR MVP: Create a collateral-based stablecoin similar to Compound's DAI, using NEAR & stNEAR as collateral


## Testing

Besides We are doing a simple ad-hoc fuzzy test for metapool.
The test generates random operations. We have a list of "invariants" the contract must satisfy to guarantee the internal accounting is consistent. We use a seeded random generator to create "operations" against the metapool (deposit, liquid-unstake, delayed-unstake, add-liquidity, remove-liquidity, end-of-epoch, compute-rewards, retrieve-funds-from-pools) in any order and amount. After each successful operation we check the contract invariants again. This is our way to tests unprepared operations combinations and make sure the internal accounting remains consistent

This is he core .rs fuzzy source https://github.com/Narwallets/meta-pool/blob/master/metapool/tests/sim/simulation_fuzzy.rs, you can navigate up from there to see what it is doing.
